# PortFolio
A portfolio to showcase my projects and past experiences


this ml branch has my machine learning for engineers projects which includes a svd hand written digits classifier , a fifa 21 player position predictor, and insurance claim predictor. We also have our LSTM text generator tutorial that I augmented to feed in whatever kind of text you want and it generates the rest.
